printman
========

Code for the world's slowest game of pacman.

Designed as a little printer[http://bergcloud.com/littleprinter/] publication, 
this app allows people to play very slow games of pacman, with one move per day.

Design
------
Code takes ascii-art board definitions like this:
```
+----+--------+----+
|....|........|....|
|.+-.|.------.|.-+.|
|.|..............|.|
|.|.--.+-==-+.--.|.|
|......|MNOP|......|
|.|.--.+----+.--.|.|
|.|..............|.|
|.+-.|.------.|.-+.|
|....|....c...|....|
+------------------+
```
And from that, generates graphics for board outline, and correctly sized pacmans etc.. (gfx.py)
Also calculated routes and information needed for playing game, and allows games to be started.

Printman uses python-png and a modified version of python-qrcode to generate graphics.
